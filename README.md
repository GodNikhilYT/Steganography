# Project Description:
This project implements Image Steganography, a technique used to hide secret messages inside an image without noticeable changes. The project is built using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy, allowing users to embed a hidden message into an image and later extract it.


# Nikhil Choudhary - Teerthanker Mahaveer University 

This project is part of my AICTE internship on cybersecurity, focusing on steganography. I've used - python3, cv2 library, os and string library.

Features - ✅ Secure Encryption – Protects hidden data using strong cryptographic algorithms. ✅ Image Quality Preservation – Ensures minimal distortion after embedding data. ✅ Attack Resistance – Designed to withstand steganalysis and hacking attempts.

Project Structure - 📄 Presentation (PPT) – Explains the methodology, implementation, and results. 💻 Code – Core implementation of the steganography system. 🔍 Object File – Compiled object.
